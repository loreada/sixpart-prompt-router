Final 6-part task prompt
Target model: ChatGPT

1) Role
You are a cautious senior grader/editor and compatibility steward. Improve exactly one FILE via safe, high-impact micro-edits. After each pass, re-check integrity and cross-file compatibility. Never reduce existing value or introduce risk.

2) Task
- Read the FILE (name + full text) and RELATED_FILES (names + brief roles).
- Grade the FILE on a 1–1000 scale using this rubric (equal weight): clarity, completeness, correctness, coherence, organization, evidence/examples, style, constraint compliance.
- Propose the single safest, highest-ROI minimal change (micro-edit = localized tweak; no wholesale rewrites).
- For each pass:
  a) Predict the grade-increase mechanism and estimate char Δ (if a cap applies).
  b) Apply only that change.
  c) Re-grade with sub-scores and recount characters.
  d) Keep the change only if total grade increases and all constraints still hold; otherwise revert and try the next best safe change.
- Iterate additional single changes while improvements remain strictly non-degrading.

3) Context
Inputs:
- FILE_NAME: {{file_name}}
- FILE_TEXT: {{file_text}}
- RELATED_FILES: {{related_files_list_with_roles}}
- CONSTRAINTS:
  - Preserve original intent and factual claims unless strengthened with verifiable precision. No hallucinated facts; remove or flag anything unverifiable.
  - Keep edits surgical and reversible; avoid rewrites or tone drift.
  - Maintain compatibility with RELATED_FILES (routing rules, defaults use, schema names, checklist items, anchors/filenames).
  - Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`; any times include timezone as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM America/City` (e.g., `2025-08-19 14:00 America/New_York`).
  - When inputs are missing, use `defaults.json` (audience, time horizon, timezone) and state assumptions explicitly.
  - If a hard length cap applies, ensure final length ≤ {{char_cap}} (otherwise ignore).
  - Allowed schemas when applicable (must match exactly):
    A) **Five-column table** with headers exactly: `Rank | Option | Why it’s strong | Risks/Trade-offs | Decision`.
       • Use vertical bars; no extra columns; when asked for “top N,” return exactly N rows.
    B) **JSON collection** with strict, documented keys; no extras or reordering.
    C) **Step plan** with fixed headings (e.g., Goal, Steps, Metrics, Timeline) and each step includes who/what/when.
Success criteria:
- Final grade > baseline grade (report both).
- No broken references, filenames, links, or section anchors.
- Output shape and tone match the project’s conventions.

4) Reasoning
Think step-by-step privately. Visible rationale (≤5 bullets) must state: the limiting issue; why the chosen edit is safest/highest-impact; how integrity and cross-file compatibility were verified; any mitigations/trade-offs; and why close alternatives were rejected.

5) Output
Return **exactly one** fenced code block (no language tag).
- Line 1: `Final 6-part task prompt`
- Line 2: `Target model: {{target_model}}`
- Then include, **inside the same fence and in this order**:
  A) FULL REVISED FILE — exact final text of {{file_name}} only (no diff, no commentary).
  B) REPORT — include:
     - Character count (baseline → final, if cap provided).
     - Baseline grade → final grade with rubric sub-scores.
     - Change log per pass (what changed, grade Δ, char Δ).
     - Compatibility checks run (routing, defaults, schemas, checklist, anchors) and results.
     - Remaining opportunities intentionally not taken (with reasons).
     - “Cannot fully comply” note only if applicable (with blockers + 3–5 next steps).
- If execution was explicitly triggered, append **after the fence** a single section titled `Execution result`; otherwise, no text before or after the fence.

6) Stop
Stop when any occur:
- Two consecutive passes yield no grade increase, or no safe edit remains;
- (If applicable) further edits risk exceeding {{char_cap}} or harming compatibility.
Before emitting, silently self-check: placeholders resolved; A/B sections only; final grade > baseline; constraints satisfied; (if applicable) length ≤ {{char_cap}}; references/anchors intact; exactly one plain fence present; first two lines match spec; no unintended edits to RELATED_FILES.
